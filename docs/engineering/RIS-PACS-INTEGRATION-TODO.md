# RIS/PACS Integration — Persistent Engineering TODO

**Purpose.** The single, Git-maintained tracker for radiology/PACS integration work on
`DrAbinash/care-on-synology1` (with `DrAbinash/care-pacs` where relevant). It exists so this work
survives context-window resets, session changes, agent handovers and machine restarts. **Read this
file before writing any code in this area, and update it before ending any session that touches it.**

**Do not** create a competing task list. Point-in-time audit reports live in `docs/audits/` and
`docs/CARE_ERP_OPEN_ISSUES.md`; those are records of past passes. This file is the live queue.

**Session start protocol:** 1) read this file; 2) `GET /repos/DrAbinash/care-on-synology1/pulls?state=all`
for the PRs named below; 3) `git fetch && git log origin/main -5`; 4) resume the first row that is
not `MERGED`/`DEPLOYED`/`VERIFIED` or explicitly `BLOCKED`; 5) do not restart a completed audit.

**Status vocabulary (deliberately not interchangeable):**

`TODO` → `INVESTIGATING` → `CONFIRMED` → `IMPLEMENTING` → `TESTING` → `PR OPEN` → `MERGED` →
`DEPLOYED` → `VERIFIED`, plus `BLOCKED` and `NOT REPRODUCED`.

- **MERGED is not DEPLOYED.** A merge to `main` changes nothing at the clinic until someone runs
  `scripts/deploy-synology.sh` on the NAS, which hard-resets to `origin/main` and rebuilds.
- **DEPLOYED is not CLINICALLY VERIFIED.** Verified means a real study, in the real workspace, on
  the deployed build, was observed behaving correctly.
- A task is never completed because a commit was written or because CI passed.

| **RIS-005** | **Correct patient is not yet correct examination in the archive** | **P0** | **Right patient, wrong exam filed into the study series** | **CONFIRMED → PR OPEN** | 7/13 cases red at `2c8bdccd` (Brain study returned report **637** = the LS Spine row, not **636**); 13/13 green at `b2ecdef9`; mutation battery A–F all killed | **#1044** (Draft) | 2/3 jobs green, `Tests + migration smoke` running | **no** | no |

| RIS-012 | Linked-sibling finalize may be refused by the ownership guard | P1 | Second study of a linked pair never marked final | INVESTIGATING (code trace only, unverified) | `radiologyReportLifecycle.ts:505` posts the same `reportId` against a **different** `worklistId`, which `radiologyIdentity.ts:250-259` refuses with `REPORT_WORKLIST_MISMATCH` | none | — | no | no |

**Deployment, all rows:** nothing above is deployed. Measured 2026-10-16 from the development
workstation: `192.168.1.137` answers ping in 7 ms, but `:8888` (care-web), `:8042` (Orthanc),
`:3010` (OHIF) and `:8080` (API) all refuse connections while `:80` returns 200. So the deployed
CARE stack is currently unreachable from here and **no deployment state can be confirmed**. The
clinic is rebuilding that deployment; until `deploy-synology.sh` is run against a known commit,
every row stays `MERGED`, not `DEPLOYED`.

## RIS-005 — correct patient is not yet correct examination (P0, active)

**In plain language.** PR #1042 stopped the PACS archive from filing *another patient's* report.
It did not yet prove the report belongs to the *right examination* of the right patient. If it is
wrong here, a radiologist could open a patient's PACS study and find the MRI Brain report sitting
inside the MRI LS Spine series — same name, same patient ID, wrong question answered.

**Mechanism read from `origin/main` (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/pacsArchive.ts:49-78`).** The
candidate list is `[worklistRowId, billedStudyId]` matched against `patient_reports.study_id`.
Because that column holds a **worklist row id** on the canonical path and a **billed study id** on
the legacy path, a report keyed to patient A's LS-Spine worklist row is reachable when archiving
patient A's Brain study **if the two integers coincide** — which they do, because the two tables
count independently.

**Required invariant.** The archived report must belong to (A) the correct patient **and** (B) the
correct radiology examination.

**Reproduced against PostgreSQL at `2c8bdccd` (the merged #1042).** One patient, an MRI BRAIN study
and an MRI LS SPINE study, the LS worklist row's primary key forced equal to the Brain study's — the
accident the two independent sequences produce by themselves. Archiving the Brain study resolved to
report **637**, the LS Spine report, instead of **636**. 7 of the 13 cases in
`pacsArchive.reportScope.request.test.ts` were red there; all 13 are green at `b2ecdef9`.

**Correction made (`b2ecdef9`, Draft PR #1044).** The legacy spelling must name the examination:

* `test_id` must equal the study's (NOT NULL on both `patient_reports` and `radiology_studies`, so no
  row can claim to be exempt);
* `bill_id`, `order_id` and `order_test_id` must not **contradict** it — absence is allowed, a
  mismatch refuses. `order_test_id` is UNIQUE on `radiology_studies`, which is the only thing that
  separates two studies of the *identical* test;
* these are the same fields `bindRadiologyIdentity`/`bindRadiologyReportIdentity`
  (`lib/radiologyIdentity.ts:115-232`) already raise `TEST_MISMATCH` / `ORDER_MISMATCH` on when the
  report is written, and copies onto the row at `routes/patient-reports.ts:2193-2195` and `:2255-2258`.
  So no report the finalize path could legitimately produce for this examination is stranded;
* the worklist leg collects **every** worklist row bound to the study rather than one, because
  duplicate modality intake binds two;
* `study_id IS NULL` stays unreachable, ambiguity returns `null`, and nothing is guessed.

Step 1 of the earlier plan — preferring `radiology_worklist.report_id` as the primary evidence — was
**not** taken: legacy rows have no back-link at all (so preferring it would delete the legacy
spelling the clinic depends on), and one report may legitimately be linked to two worklist rows
(RIS-012), so a back-link preference would refuse a flow the ERP performs today.

**Mutation battery** (`tmp/ris005-mutation-check.mjs`, gitignored; each mutant is verified to apply
before its verdict is read):

```
CONTROL (unmutated):                  Tests  13 passed (13)
A legacy leg without test_id          1 failed  × legacy row with no billing identity…
B without bill/order/order_test       1 failed  × refuses the previous year's report…
C only the first bound worklist row   1 failed  × finds the report through either worklist row
D without the patient predicate       1 failed  × never renders another patient's report…
E without newest-first order          2 failed  × deterministic pick, × amendment
F legacy leg = study_id + patient     6 failed  (#1042 exactly as merged)
```

Two fixtures had to be re-ordered before they became evidence: with the correct report written last,
a wrong-but-unsighted resolver still returned the right row because `desc(id)` happened to pick it.
The colliding and previous-year reports are now written **after** the correct one, so only a real
refusal can make those cases pass.

**Owner test cases 1-10:** 1 ✅ 2 ✅ 3 ✅ 4 ✅ (unchanged from #1042) 5 ✅ 6 ✅ 7 ✅ (the amendment
contract at `routes/patient-reports.ts:1815-1820` copies the parent's identity verbatim, so an
amendment stays in-scope and newest-first selects it) 8 ✅ 9 ✅ as behaviour (a null return makes
`archiveReportToPacs` fall back to the study's own free text, or the literal
`No report body text entered.` — never another report; worth an owner ruling on whether that fallback
should archive at all) 10 → **RIS-010**, not covered here.

**Remaining limitations.**
* Not exercised: the Chromium + Orthanc legs (no Orthanc reachable). Only the SQL pick before them is
  proven.
* Residual hole: a legacy row with **no** `bill_id`, `order_id` or `order_test_id`, naming the **same**
  test, whose `study_id` coincides with a different study of the same patient, is indistinguishable
  from its true owner and would still be adopted. Nothing in the schema separates them; guessing on
  dates would be worse. Counting such rows is the same production measurement RIS-006 needs.
* `pacsArchive.d8.test.ts`'s mocked `db` discards its `where` argument — it is structurally incapable
  of proving either half of this defect, which is now said in the file.

## RIS-006 — null `study_id` report ownership (P0, BLOCKED)

`assertReportBelongsToWorklist` (`lib/radiologyIdentity.ts:234-260`) asks only "same patient?" when
`report.study_id IS NULL`, because the whole worklist comparison sits inside `if (report.studyId)`
(`:250-259`). A patient with two studies passes that for both.

Re-measured on `2c8bdccd` (the untracked note at `tmp/null-study-ownership-note.md` carries the full
census but its line numbers are stale by 5-12 lines):

* call sites: `reportComposer/composeIdentity.ts:239`, `:362`, `:572` and
  `routes/internal-radiology.ts:1367` — the last is the load-bearing one, because finalize takes
  `reportId` from the request body;
* sign / amend / deliver do not call it;
* study-less radiology reports are **created deliberately**: `routes/patient-reports.ts:1980-1985`
  says legacy / D5-fixture / non-workspace creates keep the pre-hardening path and that requiring a
  bind for all `type=radiology` is "a separate product decision with fixture updates";
* every ERP caller that sends a `reportId` to `report-status` was enumerated:
  `diagnostic-erp/src/lib/radiologyReportLifecycle.ts:486` (the row it just finalized, which always
  carries `study_id`) and `:505` (the **same** `reportId` against a **linked sibling** worklist row).
  `pages/RadiologyWorklist.tsx:1037` sends no `reportId`, so it never reaches the guard.

**Why no code was written this session.** The two candidate corrections each hit an open question:

1. Refuse when the report's null `study_id` leaves no examination evidence → also refuses the
   documented study-less flow.
2. Refuse when **another** worklist row back-links that report → refuses `radiologyReportLifecycle.ts:505`,
   which legitimately marks one report final on a linked pair of studies (and is the behaviour RIS-012
   suspects is already broken).

**Missing evidence, named exactly.**
(a) `select count(*) from patient_reports where type='radiology' and study_id is null and status in
('final','verified','delivered')` against the clinic database — unreadable from this workstation while
the NAS refuses `:8080`;
(b) whether (a) is dominated by rows that carry `bill_id`/`order_id` (recoverable) or by rows with no
billing identity at all (not recoverable);
(c) an **owner ruling**: may one signed report legitimately be final on two worklist rows? That single
answer decides whether a back-link contradiction is a safe refusal or a clinic-wide block.
Until then this row stays `BLOCKED`; nothing here was retro-assigned, and no legacy report was touched.

## RIS-003 — post-merge verification of the APPROVED-association guard (P0)

Merged as `67fbf901`. Verify on current `main`, without changing behaviour: the guard sits at the
single shared writer `applyWorklistStudyLink`, so all five entry points inherit it — accession lane,
name±referral lane, USG DICOM intake (`internal-radiology.ts:991`), worklist entry load (`:2013`),
Reporting Studio (`internal-reporting-studio.ts:804`) and the backfill script — and `preview` refuses
with the same reason as the run. Same-patient approvals must still link, or the clinic's ultrasound
billing backlog is stranded. Status moves to `VERIFIED` only with the clinic's own data observed;
until then `MERGED`.

**Re-verified 2026-10-16 at `2c8bdccd`** (no code changed for this task): the guard is still the only
writer path, `approvedPatientAssociationAutoLink.request.test.ts` is 5/5 green against real
PostgreSQL — including the two cases that must NOT freeze: an approved row may still link a billed
study of the **same** patient, and an unapproved (`matchDecision = "NONE"`) row still links freely.
Part of the 138/138 neighbour run recorded under RIS-005. What remains outstanding is clinic-side only:
the USG billing backlog and the Match Center UI observed on the deployed build, which cannot be done
while the NAS refuses connections. **`MERGED`, and ready for the owner's own review — not `VERIFIED`.**

---

## RIS-007 — pull "success" without received instances (P1)

Confirmed in code on `main`: `moveStudy()` resolves `ok: true` on `Status.Success` **without
consulting `completed`** (`artifacts/api-server/src/services/dicom-pull-agent/dimse-agent.ts:357-368`),
and a job whose C-FIND matched nothing is finished as `completed` (`:488-492`). Whether that
misrepresented an actual clinic study is **not reproducible from this workstation** (see the
deployment note above), so the cause of any specific missing study stays unverified: it may be
(1) no studies found, (2) Success with zero objects, (3) a UTC vs local study-date window (the job's `queryDateFrom`/`queryDateTo` are built from
`toISOString()`, so a clinic day starts 5:30 UTC-off — `routes/dicom.ts:265,271`), (4) missing
instance-count verification after the move, or (5) an absent telemetry route.

**Required behaviour, expressed with the existing job/event schema (no second status framework):**
`REQUEST ACCEPTED`, `STUDIES FOUND`, `TRANSFER STARTED`, `INSTANCES RECEIVED`, `TRANSFER VERIFIED`,
`NO MATCHES`, `PARTIAL TRANSFER`, `FAILED` must remain distinguishable to the operator. Instance
counts are already recorded in `dicom_events` (`"C-MOVE OK: … (N instances)"` plus
`rawPayload.completed`), so **the first action is a read-only count of Success-with-zero rows in the
clinic's own history**, not a code change. No indefinite automatic retry. No scanner configuration.
No production C-FIND/C-MOVE without explicit owner approval.

---

## RIS-008 / RIS-009 — regression protection after the merges (P1)

Re-run the existing suites on current `main` rather than re-deriving them:
`artifacts/diagnostic-erp/src/lib/studyRegion.test.ts` (RIS-001's matrix, including the billed-name
precedence and the modality-dispatch cases longest-wins exists for) and
`artifacts/diagnostic-erp/src/lib/viewerStudyScopedReset.contract.test.ts` plus the Chromium probe
described below (RIS-002). The ERP has no DOM test harness — no jsdom, no `@testing-library` — so
viewer behaviour is proven by mounting the shipped component in a scratch Vite page and stubbing
`/api/**` in Playwright; that is the route that produced #1040's evidence.

---

## RIS-010 — archive transaction safety (P1)

Questions to answer from the existing code before proposing anything: can two archive jobs race;
can the same report be archived twice; what happens when Orthanc accepts the object but the ERP
status update fails; what happens when the report is amended afterwards; can an unsigned draft enter
the archive; can a superseded report be mistaken for the current final one; are `StudyInstanceUID`
and accession preserved. Existing mechanisms to look for first: `radiology_pacs_archive_revisions`
(per-revision records with `onConflictDoUpdate`, added by BEND-1), `pacsArchiveStatus` /
`pacsInstanceId` on `radiology_studies`, and `buildReportArtifact`'s version resolution. If they
already cover a case, record it as `VERIFIED` rather than rebuilding it.

---

## RIS-011 — MWL reality per modality (P2)

For MRI, CT, USG and X-ray separately, and never conflating **NOT CONFIGURED / NOT SUPPORTED /
NOT TESTED / CONFIGURED BUT FAILING / WORKING**: is MWL configured, is the scanner actually querying
it, does the modality send an accession, is `StudyInstanceUID` stable, is PatientID/UHID transmitted,
is billing-to-DICOM identity reliable. Known starting facts: USG has no MWL at all (which is why the
bill-desk name±referral lane exists — `internal-radiology.ts:975-991`); MR/CT do receive MWL
accessions. Recommendations land here; this is not permission to rebuild MWL infrastructure.

---

## RIS-012 — linked-sibling finalize, suspected refused (P1, hypothesis only)

Found while enumerating the `report-status` callers for RIS-006, and **not yet verified**: after
signing, `diagnostic-erp/src/lib/radiologyReportLifecycle.ts:505` posts the **same** `reportId`
against a **different** `worklistId` (the linked sibling of a paired study). On the server
`internal-radiology.ts:1367` runs `assertReportBelongsToWorklist`, whose comparison at
`radiologyIdentity.ts:250-259` resolves the report's own `study_id` to the primary worklist row and
throws `REPORT_WORKLIST_MISMATCH` when that is not the row being flipped. If true, the sibling never
reaches `REPORT_FINAL` from the workspace, and the ERP swallows it into `linkedMarkError`.

Do not act on this from the trace. Prove it with one request-level test that creates a primary +
sibling worklist row pair, finalizes the primary, and posts `report-status` for the sibling with that
`reportId` — then read the sibling row back. The answer also decides RIS-006's option 2, so it is the
cheapest next measurement in this queue.

## Standing constraints for anyone working this queue

Owner is a practising doctor, not a coder: explain the clinical consequence in plain language, and
never ask them to resolve an implementation detail that the code can answer. Audit first; reuse the
existing authoritative system; one purpose = one implementation; minimal corrections; regression test
each one; never touch production data during testing; no automatic deployment, merge, container
restart, image/volume deletion, PostgreSQL change, Orthanc data change or scanner setting change.
The AI Composer (generation, finding composition, Impression, Composer architecture) is assigned
separately — do not modify it. Patient/billing/DICOM matching generally works in the clinic: do not
redesign it, and do not treat historical match statistics as proof that the current code is broken.

**Clinical safety invariants these tasks exist to protect:** one DICOM study belongs to the correct
patient and examination; a manual Match Center approval cannot be silently replaced by automated
matching; one signed report cannot be archived under another patient's identity or another
examination merely because the patient is the same; ambiguous identity must fail safely; a signed
report must not be silently changed; a previous patient's images must not appear in another
patient's workspace; screening sequences must not change the primary examination's format; a DICOM
transfer is not successful merely because a request completed; no automated operation may substitute
a guessed identity for an approved one.

## Working-environment facts that cost the most time to rediscover

- Vitest and the API bundle need win32 native bindings that the pnpm store (populated on Linux) does
  not carry: drop `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc` and `@esbuild/win32-x64` into the worktree's
  `.pnpm/…`, and copy `lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc` / `@tailwindcss/oxide-win32-x64-msvc` from the
  main checkout. Without them `vitest run` dies inside `rollup/dist/native.js`.
- A scratch PostgreSQL 18 cluster on `127.0.0.1:5445` (never the operator's 5432, never the NAS) makes
  every `*.request.test.ts` runnable locally: `createdb` + `ALTER DATABASE … SET timezone='UTC'` +
  `DATABASE_URL=… node scripts/apply-all-migrations.mjs` (193 feature migrations).
- `@workspace/*` links in a worktree resolve into the **main checkout**, so a schema edit in the
  worktree is invisible to its own tests.
- CI runs the full suite on PostgreSQL 16; PG18's `ON DELETE RESTRICT` raises `23001` where PG16
  raises `23503`, so assert the constraint name, not the code.
- GitHub: no `gh` CLI here; REST with the operator's token file, and `git push` needs a one-off
  credential helper because Git Credential Manager hangs on a prompt that cannot render.

## Next session, in this order

1. Read `docs/engineering/RIS-PACS-INTEGRATION-TODO.md` (this file) and `GET /pulls` — do not assume
   the statuses below survived the night.
2. **RIS-005 / PR #1044**: confirm the `Tests + migration smoke` job went green, then hand it to the
   owner to merge. Do not merge it yourself. After a merge, re-check whether #1042's and #1044's rows
   are both on `main` before touching `pacsArchive.ts` again.
3. **RIS-012**: the one-request-level-test measurement — it is cheap and it unblocks RIS-006.
4. **RIS-006**: needs the NAS reachable for the null-`study_id` count, plus the owner's ruling on
   one-report-two-rows.
5. **RIS-008 / RIS-009**: re-run `studyRegion.test.ts` and the viewer contract + Chromium probe on
   current `main`. Verification, not redesign.
6. **RIS-010**: archive transaction safety, starting from `radiology_pacs_archive_revisions` and
   `pacsArchiveStatus`/`pacsInstanceId` — record what already protects the clinic before proposing
   anything.
7. **RIS-007**, **RIS-011**: read-only evidence only; no scanner changes, no production C-FIND/C-MOVE.

**Owner decisions outstanding:** (a) may one signed report legitimately be final on two worklist rows
(RIS-006/RIS-012); (b) should a study with no authoritative report archive at all, given the fallback
prints `No report body text entered.` into the DICOM object (RIS-005 case 9); (c) when the rebuilt NAS
deployment is available, which commit to deploy and with which verified backup.

_Last updated: 2026-10-16 late session — RIS-005 reproduced on PostgreSQL, corrected, mutation-checked
and opened as Draft PR #1044; RIS-003's guard re-verified green on current main; RIS-006 closed out as
BLOCKED with the exact missing evidence; RIS-012 opened from the same enumeration. Nothing deployed._
